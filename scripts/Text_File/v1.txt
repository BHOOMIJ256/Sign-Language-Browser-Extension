We work much harder than most of the people. We never sleep well and sound in the evening. I Travel last year 867 hours a year in the flat plane. In the plane. I'm working hard. My team working very hard. 18 years. We work like a normal company. 70 years, day and night. Nothing is free, nothing is easy.
